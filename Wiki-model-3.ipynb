In 1947, Lego expanded to begin producing plastic toys.\\'u\\'[9]\\'u\\'In 1949 Lego began producing, among other new products, an early version of the now familiar interlocking bricks, calling them \"Automatic Binding Bricks\". These bricks were based in part on the\\'u\\'Kiddicraft\\'u\\'Self-Locking Bricks, which were patented in the United Kingdom in 1939\\'u\\'[10]\\'u\\'and released in 1947. Lego modified the design of the Kiddicraft brick after examining a sample that they received from the supplier of an\\'u\\'injection-molding\\'u\\'machine that Lego purchased.\\'u\\'[11]\\'u\\'The bricks, originally manufactured from\\'u\\'cellulose acetate\\'u\\',\\'u\\'[12]\\'u\\'were a development of the traditional stackable wooden blocks of the time.\\'u\\'[9]\\'u\"The Lego Group\\'s motto is\"u\\'det bedste er ikke for godt\\'u\\'which means roughly \"only the best is the best\" (more literally \"the best is never too good\").\\'u\\'[8]\\'u\\'This motto, which is still used today, was created by Christiansen to encourage his employees never to skimp on quality, a value he believed in strongly.\\'u\\'[8]\\'u\"By 1951 plastic toys accounted for half of the Lego company\\'s output, even though the Danish trade magazine\"u\\'Leget\\\\xf8js-Tidende\\'u\\'(\"Toy-Times\"), visiting the Lego factory in Billund in the early 1950s, felt that plastic would never be able to replace traditional wooden toys.\\'u\\'[13]\\'u\"Although a common sentiment, Lego toys seem to have become a significant exception to the dislike of plastic in children\\'s toys, due in part to the high standards set by Ole Kirk.\"u\\'[14]\\'u\"By 1954, Christiansen\\'s son,\"u\\'Godtfred\\'u\\', had become the junior managing director of the Lego Group.\\'u\\'[13]\\'u\\'It was his conversation with an overseas buyer that led to the idea of a toy system. Godtfred saw the immense potential in Lego bricks to become a system for creative play, but the bricks still had some problems from a technical standpoint: their locking ability was limited and they were not versatile.\\'u\\'[3]\\'u\\'In 1958, the modern brick design was developed; it took five years to find the right material for it, ABS (\\'u\\'acrylonitrile butadiene styrene\\'u\\') polymer.\\'u\\'[11]\\'u\\'[12]\\'u\\'The modern Lego brick design was patented on 28 January 1958.\\'u\\'[15]\\'u\"Lego building at NASA\\'s\"u\\'Kennedy Space Center\\'u\"The Lego Group\\'s\"u\\'Duplo\\'u\\'product line was introduced in 1969 and is a range of simple blocks whose lengths measure twice the width, height and depth of standard Lego blocks and are aimed towards younger children.\\'u\\'[13]\\'u\\'[16]\\'u\\'In 1978, Lego produced the first minifigures, which have since become a staple in most sets.\\'u\\'[17]\\'u\\'In May 2011,\\'u\\'Space Shuttle Endeavour\\'u\\'mission\\'u\\'STS-134\\'u\\'brought 13 Lego kits to the\\'u\\'International Space Station\\'u\\', where astronauts built models to see how they would react in microgravity, as a part of the Lego Bricks in Space program.\\'u\\'[18]\\'u\\'[19]\\'u\\'In May 2013, the largest model ever created was displayed in New York City and was made of over 5 million bricks; a 1:1 scale model of an\\'u\\'X-wing fighter\\'u\\'.\\'u\\'[20]\\'u\\'Other records include a 112-foot (34\\\\xa0m) tower\\'u\\'[21]\\'u\\'and a 4\\\\xa0km (2.5\\\\xa0mi) railway.\\'u\\'[22]\\'u\\'[23]\\'u\\'In February 2015, Lego replaced\\'u\\'Ferrari\\'u\\'as the \"world\\\\\\'s most powerful brand.\"\\'u\\'[6]\\'u\\'[24]\\'u\\'In popular culture\\'u\\'Main article:\\'u\\'Lego in popular culture\\'u\"Lego\\'s popularity is demonstrated by its wide representation and usage in many forms of cultural works, including books, films and art work.

Despite variation in the design and the purposes of individual pieces over the years, each piece remains compatible in some way with existing pieces. Lego bricks from 1958 still interlock with those made in the current time, and Lego sets for young children are compatible with those made for teenagers. Six pieces of 2x4 bricks can be combined in 915,103,765 ways.\\'u\\'[28]\\'u\\'Each Lego piece must be manufactured to an exacting degree of precision. When two pieces are engaged they must fit firmly, yet be easily disassembled. The machines that manufacture Lego bricks have tolerances as small as 10\\'u\\'micrometres\\'u\\'.\\'u\\'[29]\\'u\\'Dimensions of some standard Lego bricks and plates\\'u\\'[30]\\'u\\'[31]\\'u\\'Primary concept and development work takes place at the Billund headquarters, where the company employs approximately 120 designers. The company also has smaller design offices in the UK, Spain, Germany, and Japan which are tasked with developing products aimed specifically at these markets. The average development period for a new product is around twelve months, split into three stages. The first stage is to identify market trends and developments, including contact by the designers directly with the market; some are stationed in toy shops close to holidays, while others interview children. The second stage is the design and development of the product based upon the results of the first stage. As of September 2008 the design teams use\\'u\\'3D modeling\\'u\\'software to generate\\'u\\'CAD\\'u\\'drawings from initial design sketches. The designs are then prototyped using an in-house\\'u\\'stereolithography\\'u\\'machine. These prototypes are presented to the entire project team for comment and for testing by parents and children during the \"validation\" process. Designs may then be altered in accordance with the results from the\\'u\\'focus groups\\'u\\'.\\'u\\'Virtual models\\'u\\'of completed Lego products are built concurrently with the writing of the user instructions. Completed CAD models are also used in the wider organisation, for marketing and packaging.\\'u\\'[32]\\'u\\'Lego Digital Designer\\'u\\'is an official piece of Lego software for\\'u\\'Mac OS X\\'u\\'and\\'u\\'Windows\\'u\\'which allows users to create their own digital Lego designs.\\'u\\'[33]\\'u\\'The program once allowed customers to order their custom designs\\'u\\'[34]\\'u\\'with a\\'u\\'service to ship physical models\\'u\\'from Digital Designer to consumers; the service ended in 2012.\\'u\\'[35]\\'u\\'Manufacturing\\'u\\'The Lego factory in\\'u\\'Kladno\\'u\\', Czech Republic\\'u\\'Lego injection moulding machines, made by the German company\\'u\\'Arburg\\'u\\'A Lego mould, showing the moulded bricks and the channels through which the plastic enters the mould at the\\'u\\'sprue, runners and gates\\'u\\'in Jiaxing, China\\'u\\'Since 1963, Lego pieces have been manufactured from a strong, resilient plastic known as\\'u\\'acrylonitrile butadiene styrene\\'u\\'(ABS).\\'u\\'[12]\\'u\\'[29]\\'u\\'As of September 2008, Lego engineers use the\\'u\\'NX\\'u\\'CAD\\'u\\'/\\'u\\'CAM\\'u\\'/\\'u\\'CAE\\'u\\'PLM\\'u\\'software suite to model the elements. The software allows the parts to be optimized by way of mould flow and\\'u\\'stress analysis\\'u\\'. Prototype moulds are sometimes built before the design is committed to mass production. The ABS plastic is heated to 232\\\\xa0\\\\xb0C (450\\\\xa0\\\\xb0F) until it reaches a\\'u\\'dough\\'u\\'-like consistency. It is then injected into the moulds at pressures between 25 and 150 tonnes, and takes approximately 15 seconds to cool. The moulds are permitted a tolerance of up to two\\'u\\'micrometres\\'u\\', to ensure the bricks remain connected.\\'u\\'[32]\\'u\\'Human inspectors check the output of the moulds, to eliminate significant variations in colour or thickness. According to the Lego Group, about eighteen bricks out of every million fail to meet the standard required.\\'u\\'[36]\\'u\\'Lego factories recycle all but about 1 percent of their\\'u\\'plastic waste\\'u\\'from the manufacturing process. If the plastic cannot be re-used in Lego bricks, it is processed and sold on to industries that can make use of it.\\'u\\'[37]\\'u\\'[38]\\'u\\'Manufacturing of Lego bricks occurs at several locations around the world. Moulding is done in Billund;\\'u\\'Ny\\\\xedregyh\\\\xe1za\\'u\\', Hungary;\\'u\\'Monterrey\\'u\\', Mexico and most recently in\\'u\\'Jiaxing\\'u\\', China. Brick decorations and packaging are done at plants in Denmark, Hungary, Mexico and\\'u\\'Kladno\\'u\\'in the Czech Republic. The Lego Group estimates that in five decades it has produced 400 billion Lego blocks.\\'u\\'[39]\\'u\\'Annual production of Lego bricks averages approximately 36 billion, or about 1140 elements per second. According to an article in\\'u\\'BusinessWeek\\'u\"in 2006, Lego could be considered the world\\'s No. 1 tire manufacturer; the factory produces about 306 million\"u\\'small rubber tires\\'u\\'a year.\\'u\\'[40]\\'u\\'The claim was reiterated in 2012.\\'u\\'[41]\\'u\"In December 2012, the BBC\\'s\"u\\'More or Less\\'u\\'radio program asked the\\'u\\'Open University\\'u\\'\\\\\\'s engineering department to determine \"how many Lego bricks, stacked one on top of the other, it would take for the weight to destroy the bottom brick?\"\\'u\\'[42]\\'u\\'Using a hydraulic testing machine, the engineering department determined the average maximum force a 2\\\\xd72 Lego brick can stand is 4,240\\'u\\'newtons\\'u\\'; since an average 2\\\\xd72 Lego brick has a mass of 1.152 grams (0.0406\\\\xa0oz), according to their calculations it would take a stack of 375,000 bricks to cause the bottom brick to collapse, which represents a stack 3,591 metres (11,781\\\\xa0ft) in height.\\'u\\'[42]\\'u\\'Private tests have shown several thousand assembly-disassembly cycles before the bricks begin to\\'u\\'wear out\\'u\\',\\'u\\'[43]\\'u\\'although Lego tests show fewer cycles.\\'u\\'[44]\\'u\\'Lego set themes\\'u\\'Further information:\\'u\\'List of Lego themes\\'u\\'A Lego set released in 2013, \"Gold Getaway\", based on the Lego Castle theme\\'u\\'Lego sets of the Lego City theme\\'u\\'Since the 1950s, the Lego Group has released thousands of sets with a variety of themes, including\\'u\\'space\\'u\\',\\'u\\'robots\\'u\\',\\'u\\'pirates\\'u\\',\\'u\\'trains\\'u\\',\\'u\\'Vikings\\'u\\',\\'u\\'castle\\'u\\',\\'u\\'dinosaurs\\'u\\',\\'u\\'undersea exploration\\'u\\', and\\'u\\'wild west\\'u\\'.

The roots of the product originate from a programmable brick developed at the\"u\\'MIT Media Lab\\'u\\', and the name is taken from a paper by\\'u\\'Seymour Papert\\'u\\', a computer scientist and educator who developed the educational theory of\\'u\\'constructionism\\'u\\', and whose research was at times funded by the\\'u\\'Lego Group\\'u\\'.\\'u\\'[49]\\'u\"The programmable Lego brick which is at the heart of these robotics sets has undergone several updates and redesigns, with the latest being called the \\'EV3\\' brick, being sold under the name of Lego Mindstorms EV3. The set includes sensors that detect touch, light, sound and ultrasonic waves, with several others being sold separately, including an\"u\\'RFID\\'u\\'reader.\\'u\\'[50]\\'u\\'The intelligent brick can be programmed using official software available for\\'u\\'Windows\\'u\\'and\\'u\\'Mac\\'u\\'computers, and is downloaded onto the brick via\\'u\\'Bluetooth\\'u\\'or a USB cable. There are also several unofficial programs and compatible programming languages that have been made to work with the brick, and many books have been written to support this community.\\'u\\'[50]\\'u\\'There are several robotics competitions which use the Lego robotics sets. The earliest is\\'u\\'Botball\\'u\\', a national U.S.\\'u\\'middle\\'u\\'- and\\'u\\'high-school\\'u\\'competition stemming from the MIT 6.270 Lego robotics tournament. Other Lego robotics competitions include\\'u\\'Junior FIRST LEGO League\\'u\\'(Jr.FLL) for students ages 6\\\\u20139,\\'u\\'FIRST Lego League\\'u\\'(FLL) for students ages 9\\\\u201316 (age 9\\\\u201314 in the United States, Canada, and Mexico), and FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) for high school students. Jr.FLL FLL, and FTC offer real-world engineering challenges to participants. FLL uses Lego-based robots to complete tasks. Jr.FLL participants build models out of Lego elements. FTC uses the NXT Intelligent brick and its pieces along with another building platform called TETRIX. In its 2010 season, there were 16,070 FLL teams in over 55 countries. In its 2010 season, there were 2,147 Jr.FLL teams with 12,882 total student participants in the\\'u\\'United States\\'u\\'and\\'u\\'Canada\\'u\\'. The international\\'u\\'RoboCup Junior\\'u\\'football\\'u\\'competition involves extensive use of\\'u\\'Lego Mindstorms\\'u\\'equipment which is often pushed to its extreme limits.\\'u\\'[51]\\'u\"The capabilities of the Mindstorms range have now been harnessed for use in Iko Creative Prosthetic System, a prosthetic limbs system designed for children. Designs for these Lego prosthetics allow everything from mechanical diggers to laser-firing spaceships to be screwed on to the end of a child\\'s limb. Iko is the work of the Chicago-based Colombian designer Carlos Arturo Torres, and is a modular system that allows children to customise their own prosthetics with the ease of clicking together plastic bricks. Designed with Lego\\'s Future Lab, the Danish toy company\\'s experimental research department, and Cirec, a Colombian foundation for physical rehabilitation, the modular prosthetic incorporates myoelectric sensors that register the activity of the muscle in the stump and send a signal to control movement in the attachment. A processing unit in the body of the prosthetic contains an engine compatible with Lego Mindstorms, the company\\'s robotics line, which lets the wearer build an extensive range of customised, programmable limbs.\"u\\'[52]\\'u\\'[53]\\'u\\'Clones of Lego\\'u\\'Main article:\\'u\\'Lego clone\\'u\\'The definitive shape of the Lego bricks, with the inner tubes, was patented by the Lego Group in 1958.\\'u\\'[15]\\'u\\'[54]\\'u\"Several competitors have attempted to take advantage of Lego\\'s popularity by producing blocks of similar dimensions, and advertising them as being compatible with Lego bricks.

Organic oils may also contain chemicals other than lipids, including\\'u\\'proteins\\'u\\',\\'u\\'waxes\\'u\\'(class of compounds with oil-like properties that are solid at common temperatures) and\\'u\\'alkaloids\\'u\\'.\\'u\\'Lipids can be classified by the way that they are made by an organism, their chemical structure and their limited\\'u\\'solubility\\'u\\'in water compared to oils. They have a high\\'u\\'carbon\\'u\\'and\\'u\\'hydrogen\\'u\\'content and are considerably lacking in\\'u\\'oxygen\\'u\\'compared to other organic compounds and minerals; they tend to be relatively\\'u\\'nonpolar\\'u\\'molecules, but may include both polar and nonpolar regions as in the case of\\'u\\'phospholipids\\'u\\'and steroids.\\'u\\'[7]\\'u\\'Mineral oils\\'u\\'Crude oil, or\\'u\\'petroleum\\'u\\', and its refined components, collectively termed\\'u\\'petrochemicals\\'u\\', are crucial resources in the modern economy. Crude oil originates from ancient\\'u\\'fossilized\\'u\\'organic materials\\'u\\', such as\\'u\\'zooplankton\\'u\\'and\\'u\\'algae\\'u\\', which\\'u\\'geochemical\\'u\\'processes convert into oil.\\'u\\'[8]\\'u\\'The name \"mineral oil\" is a\\'u\\'misnomer\\'u\\', in that minerals are not the source of the oil\\\\u2014ancient plants and animals are. Mineral oil is organic. However, it is classified as \"mineral oil\" instead of as \"organic oil\" because its organic origin is remote (and was unknown at the time of its discovery), and because it is obtained in the vicinity of rocks, underground traps, and sands.\\'u\\'Mineral oil\\'u\\'also refers to several specific distillates of crude oil.\\'u\\'Applications\\'u\\'Cooking\\'u\\'Main article:\\'u\\'Cooking oil\\'u\\'Several edible vegetable and animal oils, and also\\'u\\'fats\\'u\\', are used for various purposes in cooking and food preparation. In particular, many foods are fried in oil much hotter than boiling water. Oils are also used for flavoring and for modifying the texture of foods (e.g.\\'u\\'Stir Fry\\'u\\'). Cooking oils are derived either from animal fat, as\\'u\\'butter\\'u\\',\\'u\\'lard\\'u\\'and other types, or plant oils from the\\'u\\'olive\\'u\\',\\'u\\'maize\\'u\\',\\'u\\'sunflower\\'u\\'and many other species.\\'u\\'Cosmetics\\'u\\'Oils are applied to hair to give it a lustrous look, to prevent tangles and roughness and to stabilize the hair to promote growth. See\\'u\\'hair conditioner\\'u\\'.\\'u\\'Religion\\'u\\'Oil has been used throughout history as a religious medium. It is often considered a spiritually purifying agent and is used for\\'u\\'anointing\\'u\\'purposes. As a particular example,\\'u\\'holy anointing oil\\'u\\'has been an important ritual liquid for\\'u\\'Judaism\\'u\\'and\\'u\\'Christianity\\'u\\'.\\'u\\'Painting\\'u\\'Color\\'u\\'pigments\\'u\\'are easily\\'u\\'suspended\\'u\\'in oil, making it suitable as a supporting medium for\\'u\\'paints\\'u\\'.

Heat transfer oils are used both as\\'u\\'coolants\\'u\\'(see\\'u\\'oil cooling\\'u\\'), for heating (e.g. in\\'u\\'oil heaters\\'u\\') and in other applications of heat transfer.\\'u\\'Lubrication\\'u\\'Given that they are non-polar, oils do not easily adhere to other substances. This makes them useful as\\'u\\'lubricants\\'u\\'for various engineering purposes. Mineral oils are more commonly used as machine lubricants than biological oils are.\\'u\\'Whale oil\\'u\\'is preferred for lubricating clocks, because it does not evaporate, leaving dust, although its use was banned in the USA in 1980.\\'u\\'[10]\\'u\\'It is a long-running myth that\\'u\\'spermaceti\\'u\\'from whales has still been used in NASA projects such as the\\'u\\'Hubble Telescope\\'u\\'and the\\'u\\'Voyager\\'u\\'probe because of its extremely low freezing temperature. Spermaceti is not actually an oil, but a mixture mostly of wax esters, and there is no evidence that NASA has used whale oil.\\'u\\'[11]\\'u\\'Fuel\\'u\\'Synthetic motor oil\\'u\\'Some oils\\'u\\'burn\\'u\\'in liquid or\\'u\\'aerosol\\'u\\'form, generating\\'u\\'light\\'u\\', and\\'u\\'heat\\'u\\'which can be used directly or converted into other forms of energy such as electricity or mechanical work.
